## 🧪 Scientific Background

### Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others. Instead, a quantum state must be described for the system as a whole.

In quantum communication, entanglement serves as a resource that enables protocols such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution.

### Noise in Quantum Systems

Quantum systems are extremely sensitive to environmental interactions, which introduce noise and errors. This simulator models several types of noise:

- **Depolarizing Noise**: Randomly replaces the quantum state with a completely mixed state

- **Amplitude Damping**: Models energy dissipation (e.g., spontaneous emission)

- **Phase Damping**: Represents loss of quantum information without energy exchange

### Purification Protocols

Quantum purification protocols are methods to improve the fidelity of entangled states by using multiple lower-fidelity entangled pairs to distill fewer pairs with higher fidelity. This is crucial for long-distance quantum communication where noise accumulates over distance.

### Fidelity Measurement

Fidelity is a measure of how close two quantum states are to each other. In our simulator, it represents how well the actual entangled state matches the ideal target state. A fidelity of 1.0 represents a perfect match, while lower values indicate degradation due to noise.

### BB84 Protocol and Eavesdropper Detection

The BB84 protocol, developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, is a quantum key distribution scheme that enables two parties (Alice and Bob) to establish a shared secret key while detecting any eavesdropping attempts. The protocol works by:

- **Quantum State Transmission**: Alice sends qubits encoded in randomly chosen bases (rectilinear '+' or diagonal 'x')
- **Measurement**: Bob measures received qubits in randomly chosen bases
- **Sifting**: Alice and Bob publicly compare bases and discard mismatched measurements
- **Error Detection**: By comparing a subset of their sifted key, they can detect eavesdropping through increased error rates

When an eavesdropper (Eve) intercepts and measures the quantum states, she introduces errors that Alice and Bob can detect. The simulator implements this detection mechanism by monitoring error rates and comparing them against a threshold (typically 11% for BB84), allowing for automatic identification of security breaches.
